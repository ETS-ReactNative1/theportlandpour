          <p>
            Choosing a sponsorship level depends on your marketing goals, how you want to use The Portland Pour, and if you need any of our creative services.
            It also depends on your budget and overall return on the investment when compared to your existing marketing spend.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those considering a sustaining sposorship, we recommend considering the sponsorship cost as a way to reduce the cost of both online promotion and creative support.
            How much do you spend for online advertising and does The Portland Pour fit with your target audience?
            How much do you spend on product photography, design, printing, or events?
            Is eleminating or reducing those costs valuable to your brand?
          </p>
          <p>
            For many, it isn't.
            You may already have your creative covered, either in house or with existing vendors, and that's fine.
            We have a sponsorship level for you that includes our content, workshops, and all the other stuff, but saves significant cost by limiting the benefits of sponsorship to just the features you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, perhaps you're not in Portland.
            We only accept a limited number of sustaining sponsors each year, and we do require that they be in Portland or somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.
            If that's the case, we do apollogize, but would still love your support, and invite you to consider one of our other sponsorship levels.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4 class="text-center">How we choose</h4>
          <p>
            Community sponsorship is open to all, however, there are only a few sustaining sponsors.
            When we consider the level of service and care we offer our sustaining sponsors, we have to limit the number we accpet each year.
            Often, this is a difficult decision, and there are times when we get more requests than we can accommodate.
          </p>
          <p>
            When selecting sustaining sponsors, we start with the order in which we received requests to become a sponsor, and the location of the potential sponsor.
            We also consider the appropriateness of the brand, and whether it will be a good fit for The Portland Pour.
            Ideally, we'll be able to accomodate a group of sustaining sponsors who's products compliment each other, and that give us a good selection of spirits and items that we can use in our art and recipes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Startup sponsors are also restricted to beverage startups in Oregon.
            We know the overwhelming cost associated with a new business, and we want you to have the best start possible.
            However, we do ask that startups only avail themselves of this option once.
